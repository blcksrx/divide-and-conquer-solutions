# Algorithms solutions

The solutions to the assignments of Stanford’s Design and analysis of algorithms course.

##Assignment 1
Implement Karatsuba’s algorithm for the multiplication of integers.

##Assignment 2
Implement an algorithm that counts the inversions in an array of integers in less than quadratic time. In an array of non-negative integers, an inversion refers to a number at a lower index that is higher than a number at a higher index.

##Assignment 3
Implement the Quicksort algorithm that returns the number of comparisons made during sorting an array of integers. Compare the number of comparisons using exclusively the first, last and median-of-three elements as pivots. (Also added comparison using randomly chosen pivots).
